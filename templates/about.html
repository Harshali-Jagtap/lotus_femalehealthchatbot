        <div class="about-card" data-icon="🌸">
            <h4>Our Mission</h4>
            <p>Lotus was created to make women’s health and wellbeing support more accessible, inclusive, and
                stigma-free — especially for students. It’s a private, always-on companion offering guidance,
                encouragement, and trustworthy information.</p>

        <div class="about-card" data-icon="👩‍💻">
            <h4>Meet the Creator</h4>
            <p>Hi! I’m Harshali, the creator of Lotus. As a student, I realized how hard it can be to ask for help —
                especially when it comes to topics like periods, anxiety, or hormones. Lotus is my way of offering a
                safe space, backed by tech and care.</p>

            <ul class="how-it-works-steps">

                <li>🔍 <strong>Lotus Understands</strong> – It uses natural language to interpret your intent.</li>
                <li>🧠 <strong>It Searches</strong> – Medical databases like MedQuAD & DrugBank (with strict fallback
                    rules).
                </li>
                <li>✅ <strong>You Get Support</strong> – Friendly, non-judgmental info & advice.</li>

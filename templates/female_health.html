        <h4>General Female Health</h4>
        <p>
            Maintaining overall health is essential at every stage of a woman’s life — from adolescence through
            menopause and beyond.
            Female health goes beyond just reproductive care and includes physical, mental, emotional, and social
            wellbeing.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Mental Health:</strong> Women are more prone to anxiety and depression. Stress management, sleep,
            and emotional support are key.

        <p><strong>Nutrition:</strong> Iron, calcium, and folate are crucial for bone health and hormonal balance.

        </p>

        <p><strong>Physical Activity:</strong> At least 150 minutes of moderate activity weekly is recommended.

        </p>

        <p><strong>Preventive Care:</strong> Routine checkups, cervical screening (Pap smears), and breast exams help
            catch problems early.

        <p><strong>Hydration & Sleep:</strong> Stay hydrated and sleep 7–9 hours per night for optimal brain and

        <h4>Periods & Menstrual Health</h4>

        <p>
            Menstrual health is a key part of overall wellbeing and reproductive health. Understanding how the menstrual
            cycle works can help reduce anxiety and detect irregularities early.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Menstrual Cycle Basics:</strong> The average cycle lasts 21–35 days. Tracking your period helps
            monitor hormonal patterns, fertility, and overall health.
            <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/periods/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[NHS Period Overview]</a>
        </p>

        <p><strong>PMS & Cramps:</strong> Mild to moderate discomfort is common, but persistent or severe pain may
            indicate conditions like endometriosis or Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Use heat, exercise, and rest —
            and consult a doctor when
            needed.

               target="_blank" rel="noopener">[Mayo Clinic PMS]</a>
        </p>

        <p><strong>Period Hygiene:</strong> Change pads/tampons every 4–6 hours to prevent infection. Avoid fragrance
            products and wash with mild, unscented soap.
            <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hygiene/about/menstrual-hygiene.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[CDC
                Menstrual Hygiene]</a>
        </p>

        <p><strong>Tracking Tools:</strong> Apps like Clue or Flo can help identify cycles, ovulation, and symptoms.
            This data is helpful for doctors and self-awareness.
        </p>

        <p><strong>When to Seek Help:</strong> Extremely heavy bleeding, irregular periods, or intense pain should
            not be ignored. Always consult a healthcare professional.

        <h4>Pregnancy & Fertility</h4>

        <p>
            Pregnancy is a unique journey that requires physical, emotional, and informational support. Whether planning
            to conceive or already expecting, understanding your body’s signals is key to a healthy experience.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Fertility Awareness:</strong> Ovulation tracking, cycle awareness, and hormonal health play a
            central role in conception. Maintaining a healthy weight, reducing stress, and managing thyroid levels can
            support fertility.

                Advice]</a>
        </p>

        <p><strong>Prenatal Care:</strong> As soon as pregnancy is confirmed, schedule regular checkups. Folic acid,
            iron, and multivitamins are crucial for early fetal development.

                Acid]</a>
        </p>

        <p><strong>Healthy Pregnancy Habits:</strong> Eat a balanced diet, stay hydrated, and avoid smoking, alcohol,
            or raw seafood. Moderate exercise like walking or yoga is beneficial.

            swelling, seek medical care immediately.

            Female reproductive health includes understanding the organs, hormones, and potential conditions that affect
            fertility, menstruation, and daily comfort. Early awareness and preventive care make a huge difference.
        </p>

        <p><strong>PCOS (Polycystic Ovary Syndrome):</strong> A hormonal imbalance causing irregular periods, acne,
            and weight changes. It’s treatable with diet, medication, and hormone therapy.

        </p>

        <p><strong>Endometriosis:</strong> When uterine tissue grows outside the uterus, it causes severe cramps and
            heavy bleeding. Treatments include pain management, hormones, and sometimes surgery.

        </p>

        <p><strong>UTIs (Urinary Tract Infections):</strong> Burning while urinating, frequent urges, and pelvic pain
            are signs. Stay hydrated and seek antibiotics when needed.

        <h4>Menopause & Hormonal Changes</h4>

        <p>
            Menopause is a natural transition that typically occurs between ages 45–55. Hormonal shifts can affect your
            mood, body, and mind — but they can be managed with the right knowledge and support.
        </p>

        <p><strong>What is Menopause?</strong> Defined as 12 months without a period. Symptoms like hot flashes,
            restlessness, and mood swings may begin in perimenopause (the transition phase).
            <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/menopause/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[NHS: Menopause]</a>
        </p>

        <p><strong>Coping with Symptoms:</strong> Exercise, cool sleeping environments, and deep breathing can
            help. Some women benefit from hormone replacement therapy (HRT).

        <p>
            Personal hygiene is important throughout every stage of life — not just for cleanliness, but for confidence
            and health. From puberty to post-menopause, hygiene needs to evolve.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Puberty & Teens:</strong> Begin using gentle cleansers, wear breathable underwear, and change pads
            regularly during periods.
